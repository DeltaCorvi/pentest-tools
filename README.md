# Pentesting Tools for Fun & Profit

By day, I edit a LOT of penetration test reports, and I like to bookmark tools I see that look cool and are references in the various reports. This is by no means a complete list of all the wonderful tools and toys out there, but it may help get yoiu started.

Share and Enjoy!
